## neovim setup

My personal neovim setup. Trying to keep it minimal.

Copy `lua.init` into `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` and make sure you have neovim
installed. Then just enter neovim.

### shortcuts

Note: <leader> is \

In normal mode:

- \sf = [S]earch [F]iles
- \sw = [S]earch current [W]ord
- \sg = [S]earch by [G]rep
- ,nt = toggle nvim tree
- \c  = comment line/selection
- C   = change root dir in nvim tree
